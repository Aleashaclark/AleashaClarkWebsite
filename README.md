The purpose of this repo is to hold all of my files associated and needed for my website, and to enable version control aka source control over my website.



Steps Taken to set up Git and push code

1.I installed Git on my local Windows machine.

2.Initialized a Git Repo by navigating to the \\aleashawebsite directory via the command line. Then running a few commands (git init, git config --global user.name Aleasha Clark, git config --global user.email MyEmail).These commands initialize and set my username and email.

3.Run a few more git commands. (git add ., git commit -m Message.). These commands added all of my website files to the staging area and then commited those same files to my LOCAL REPO.)                            4.Created a New Public Repo on GitHub. Set name and made public.

5.Linked my local repo to my GitHub repo. (git remote add origin httpsGitHubWebsite-RepoLinkPath).                                                                                                                      6.Pushed my local repo to my GitHub repo. (git push -u origin master).



Challenges



The only challenge I faced was not knowing a lot of PowerShell commands. I could have easily probably done mostly everything from the GUI, but I wanted to challenge myself and do everything from the PowerShell terminal. I am more familiar with Linux commands. But I used that knowledge to just to do a quick Google search of the commands I needed to do what I needed to do. Such as, creating this README file, adding contents and viewing what I added all from the command line. Was simple to figure out.
