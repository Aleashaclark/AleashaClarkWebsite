The purpose of this repo is to hold all of my files associated and needed for my website, and to enable version control aka source control over my website.

### <ins>Steps Taken to set up Git and push code</ins>                                                                   
1.Installed Git on my local Windows machine.

2.Initialized Git Repo - Navigating to the \\aleashawebsite directory via the command line. Then, ran the git init command.

3.Configured my Git commit credentials - Using these commands --> git config --global user.name Aleasha Clark and git config --global user.email MyEmail. These credentials will be attached to all commits I make globally, meaning regardless of what repo I am in.

4.Run a few more git commands - git add . will add all of my website files to the staging area. git commit -m "meaningful message" will commit those files in the staged area to my local repo.

4.Created & Configured a new Repo on GitHub - Set repo name to AleashaClarkWebsite and made public per requirements. 

5.Linked my local repo to my GitHub repo - git remote add origin https://github.com/Aleashaclark/AleashaClarkWebsite.git. This command tells my local repo to push commits to this remote repo.   

6.Pushed my local repo commits to my remote repo - git push -u origin master. This command pushed my local repo commits to my remote repo while also specifying that origin master as the default for future pushes.

### Challenges  
The only challenge I faced was not knowing a lot of PowerShell commands. I could have easily probably done mostly everything from the GUI, but I wanted to challenge myself and do everything from the PowerShell terminal. I am more familiar with Linux commands. But I used that knowledge to just to do a quick Google search of the commands I needed to do what I needed to do. Such as, creating this README file, adding contents and viewing what I added all from the command line. Was simple to figure out.
